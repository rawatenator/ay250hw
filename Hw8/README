Question1:
	done

Question2: see question2.txt


Question3:
	In question3.py, I defined an argparse parser object.
	To add data use the keyword: -add and use the appropriate
	tags to add polling data(use -h to see all of the tags available).
	To see a graph of the data, you can use the keyword -graph. Be sure 
	to indicate the full name of a state when using -graph and/or -add.
	When -graph or -add are used, a boolean variable changes to True in
	the code, determining if a sql insert will occur(-add) or if the graph
	program will be called. 

	-All of the database functions are stored in a 
	file called Hw5.py in the Hw5 directory. To import the modules, I appended 
	a path to the sys.path corresponding to the parent directory which contains
	folders for my homework assignments(the directory with folders for Hw1, Hw2 etc.).
	Since this path can be used to load modules while question3.py is running, I was able
	to import modules from Hw5/Hw5.py with Hw5.Hw5 . 

	-for other requirements, please consult question3.py, which should be fairly 
	straightforward to interpret w/comments. 

Question4:
	I followed the instructions. The files are in this directory under the folder bloomdemo. See the log(log.txt) for proof of the commits.
