# !3.!Elections are coming up, and we want to re-use our code to 
# see how things are going!  Download the latest polling data 
# from http://electoral-vote.com/evp2010/Senate/ 
# senate_polls.raw (or .csv) into your Week 8 homework folder.  
# Without moving the base code from your Week 5 (databases) 
# folder*, load the necessary functions from that code into a new 
# module for your Week 8 folder which parses command-line 
# input using argparse.  Allow the user to input new polls into 
# the database without requiring a speciﬁc format.  Include an 
# option which shows a plot of the updated polls for a given 
# state.  Include the necessary checks to make sure the user’s 
# path is set correctly to import the code from Week 5.
