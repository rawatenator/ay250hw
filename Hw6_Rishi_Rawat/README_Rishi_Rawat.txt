Hw 6 by Rishi Rawat for AY 250, rawat@berkeley.edu

-My program downloads an image from the yahoo-api(pYsearch 3.1) determined URL and saving it locally for manipulations. A matplotlib editor from the enthought tutorial website was used to add the plot to the GUI. I have commented my code and believe it should be straightforward.

-To use the program, execute the file Hw6.py from the directory. I believe all of the dependencies on the Yahoo webservice will be fine because I placed the modules in the same directory as Hw6. 

-I have tested the program on Python 2.6.5 |EPD 6.2-2 (32-bit) and it works.
