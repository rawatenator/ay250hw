NOTE:
If you would like to see EVERYTHING in action, remove poll.db from the directory, run the methods:
q0();q1();q2();q3();q4();q5();q6()

Methods numbered 0 to 3 will setup the tables; 4,5,6 will do the rest of the tasks

SUMMARY OF ANSWERS:



a. PLEASE DOWNLOAD THE LATEST SENATE POLLING DATA FROM EITHER HTTP:// 
ELECTORAL-VOTE.COM/EVP2010/SENATE/SENATE_POLLS.RAW OR HTTP:// 
ELECTORAL-VOTE.COM/EVP2010/SENATE/SENATE_POLLS.CSV, (WHICHEVER 
FORMAT YOU PREFER), AND PUT THESE DATA INTO A SQLITE3 TABLE. 

	see the function q1, data stored in table: rankings (id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT, day INTEGER,len INTEGER, state TEXT, dem INTEGER,rep INTEGER, indep INTEGER, month int,dayofmonth int, poll text);
	

B. NOTE THAT THE NAMES OF THE CANDIDATES ARE NOT LISTED IN THE DATA 
ABOVE, BUT THIS IS SOMETHING WE'D LIKE TO KNOW.  MAKE A SECOND TABLE 
LISTING THE DEMOCRAT, REPUBLICAN, AND INDEPENDENT (IF ANY) CANDIDATES 
FOR EACH STATE, AS WELL AS THE INCUMBENT PARTY (SEE HTTP:// 
ASTRO.BERKELEY.EDU/~AMORGAN/CANDIDATE_NAMES.TXT) 

	see q2, data stored in table: candidate_names(state TEXT, democrat text, republican text, independent text, incumbentparty text );
	

C. IMAGES FOR EACH CANDIDATE ARE LOCATED AT HTTP://ASTRO.BERKELEY.EDU/ 
~AMORGAN/CANDIDATES/ - CREATE A NEW TABLE WHICH INCLUDES LINKS TO THE 
IMAGE FOR EACH CANDIDATE.  IF YOU’D PREFER TO MAKE THE LINKS LOCAL, YOU 
CAN DOWNLOAD ALL THE IMAGES FROM HTTP://ASTRO.BERKELEY.EDU/~AMORGAN/ 
CANDIDATES.ZIP 

	photos stored locally, see q3, data stored in table: images(name TEXT,url TEXT);

D. USING THE NECESSARY SQLITE3 JOINS TO LINK THE TABLES TOGETHER, MAKE A 
PYTHON FUNCTION WITH A SIMPLE COMMAND-LINE QUERY ENGINE THAT ALLOWS 
YOU TO SEARCH BY STATE WHICH SHOWS THE RESULT IN A WEB BROWSER POP- 
UP (SEE HTTP://DOCS.PYTHON.ORG/LIBRARY/WEBBROWSER.HTML).  LIST THE 
CANDIDATES, THEIR PHOTOS, THEIR LATEST POLLS, AND WHETHER CURRENT 
PREDICTIONS INDICATE THERE WILL BE A PARTY SWITCH FROM LAST TIME (I.E. IS 
THE PERSON CURRENTLY IN THE LEAD IN A DIFFERENT PARTY (REPUBLICAN, 
DEMOCRAT, OR INDEPENDENT) THAN THE INCUMBENT PARTY?) '

	see q4


E. BASED ON THE LATEST POLLING DATA, HOW MANY TOTAL SENATE SEATS ARE THE 
DEMOCRATS POISED TO LOSE THIS ELECTION?  (IF YOU'RE REALLY AMBITIOUS, 
YOU CAN TAKE SOME SORT OF WEIGHTED AVERAGE OF THE LAST FEW POLLS FOR 
EACH STATE, WEIGHTING MORE RECENT POLLS MORE HEAVILY - BUT TAKING THE 
LATEST POLL FOR EACH STATE WILL BE ﬁNE FOR THIS EXERCISE.) 


	see q5

F. MAKE A FUNCTION THAT WILL PLOT ALL THE AVAILABLE POLLING DATA FOR A STATE, 
USING A RED LINE FOR REPUBLICAN CANDIDATES, A BLUE LINE FOR DEMOCRATS, 
AND SOME OTHER COLOR FOR AN INDEPENDENT, IF THERE IS ONE.  INCLUDE A 
LEGEND THAT HAS THE CANDIDATE'S NAME (E.G., SOMETHING LIKE THE BELOW) 

	see q6
G. MAKE A FUNCTION THAT WILL ALLOW YOU TO ADD A NEW POLL TO THE DATABASE 
AND UPDATE THE DATABASE ACCORDINGLY.  

	see enterData
