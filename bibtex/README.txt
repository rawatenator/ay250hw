Django Hw Assignment(HW 7 )

I have built the site with all necessary components. 
It is well documented and should be straightforward. 
I tested the site on two bibtex files, one from the
internet, the other from Chris K.(posted on Bspace),
these files are located in bibtex/Sample bibtex and
should work when updated. Of course other bibtex sh-
ould work too, just heed the advice on the upload p-
age about making the bibtex file compatible with the
website database.


To start the site, go to http://127.0.0.1:8000/ (af-
ter executing: python manage.py runserver). Then use
the links to go to the page of interest.
